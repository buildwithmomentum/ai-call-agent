**`Core Modules and Connections`**

1. **`Agent Creation Platform`**`:`  
   * **`Functionality`**`: Allows businesses to design and customize AI agents.`  
   * **`Connections`**`: Utilizes OpenAI API for AI capabilities, integrates with Pinecone for vector storage of FAQs and policies.`  
2. **`Call Routing`**`:`  
   * **`Functionality`**`: Routes complex queries to human agents with context.`  
   * **`Connections`**`: Uses Twilio for call handling, interacts with the Agent Creation module for context retrieval, and Supabase for storing logs.`  
3. **`Appointment Booking`**`:`  
   * **`Functionality`**`: Enables scheduling, modifying, and canceling appointments.`  
   * **`Connections`**`: Integrates with Twilio for voice interaction, Supabase for storing schedules, and Pinecone for understanding appointment intents.`  
4. **`Basic Reporting`**`:`  
   * **`Functionality`**`: Provides performance insights such as AI resolution rate and chat logs.`  
   * **`Connections`**`: Fetches data from Supabase and formats it for display, connects to all other modules for data collection.`  
5. **`Secure and Scalable Infrastructure`**`:`  
   * **`Functionality`**`: Ensures compliance with security standards and supports high concurrent user volumes.`  
   * **`Connections`**`: Supports all modules by providing stable and secure API endpoints.`

### **`Approach and Development Strategy`**

1. **`Setup and Foundation`** `(Week 1):`  
   * `Establish the development environment using Next.js.`  
   * `Configure Twilio, OpenAI, Pinecone, and Supabase integrations.`  
   * `Define database schemas in Supabase for agents, logs, appointments, and user data.`  
2. **`Parallel Development`** `(Weeks 2-3):`  
   * `Divide the team into module-specific sub-teams.`  
   * `Work on Agent Creation Platform and Appointment Booking as high-priority modules.`  
   * `Develop Call Routing and Basic Reporting concurrently with foundational components ready.`  
3. **`Integration and Testing`** `(Week 4):`  
   * `Connect all modules for end-to-end functionality.`  
   * `Perform rigorous testing for edge cases, performance, and security.`  
   * `Prepare deployment scripts and documentation.`

### **`Branching Strategy`**

1. **`Main Branch`**`: main`  
   * `Contains production-ready code.`  
2. **`Feature Branches`**`:`  
   * `feature/agent-creation`  
   * `feature/call-routing`  
   * `feature/appointment-booking`  
   * `feature/reporting`  
   * `feature/infrastructure`  
3. **`Bug Fixes and Testing`**`:`  
   * `fix/testing`  
4. **`Release Preparation`**`:`  
   * `release/v1.0`

### **`Sprint Plan`**

#### **`Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2)`**

* **`Goals`**`:`  
  * `Complete foundational setups and start development of core modules.`

  * `Start Appointment Booking module:`  
    * `Create Supabase schema.`  
    * `API for creating, modifying, and canceling appointments.`  
  * `Initiate Secure Infrastructure setup:`  
    * `Configure API endpoints with authentication and rate limiting.`

#### **`Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4)`**

* **`Goals`**`:`  
  * `Complete and integrate all modules.`  
  * `Conduct testing and finalize deployment.`  
* **`Tasks`**`:`  
  * `Finalize Call Routing:`  
    * `Develop Twilio integration for routing and escalation.`  
    * `API for logging and forwarding query context.`  
  * `Implement Reporting Module:`
