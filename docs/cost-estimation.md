# Cost Estimation for OpenAI Realtime Operations

## Overview
This document provides a cost estimation for using OpenAI's GPT-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17 in a real-time voice AI system. The estimation is based on a test case designed to simulate the maximum cost scenario for a one-minute call session.

## Test Case Details
- **Model Used:** GPT-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17
- **Session Duration:** 1 minute 10 seconds
- **System Prompt:** Very long and detailed instructions
- **Tools Used:** 7 tools integrated
- **Interaction:** Multiple interruptions and requests during the session
- **Context:** Lengthy conversation history and input context due to function calls from the knowledge base
- **Cost:** $0.22 for 1 minute 10 seconds

## Cost Breakdown
1. **GPT-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17**
   - This model costs double when a system prompt is provided.
   - In our test case, the high cost was due to:
     - A very long system prompt
     - Multiple tools being used
     - Frequent interruptions and large input contexts

2. **GPT-4o-realtime-mini-preview-2024-12-17**
   - Costs half of GPT-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17.
   - For the same test case, the cost would be approximately $0.11 for 1 minute 10 seconds.

3. **Optimized Scenarios**
   - If business requirements are less demanding (e.g., shorter system prompts, fewer tools, simpler interactions), the cost can be significantly reduced.

## Alternative Low-Cost Solution
Our application also offers an alternative to GPT-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17. This system is designed for fast and low-latency operations while minimizing costs. It uses:
- **OpenAI Speech-to-Text (STT)**
- **Grok LLM**
- **ElevenLabs for Text-to-Speech (TTS)**

This alternative system provides similar functionality at a much lower cost, making it ideal for scenarios where cost is a primary concern.

## Summary
- **Maximum Cost Scenario:** $0.22 per minute using GPT-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17.
- **Reduced Cost Option:** $0.11 per minute using GPT-4o-realtime-mini-preview-2024-12-17.
- **Alternative System:** Further cost reduction with our custom low-latency solution.

For businesses with less demanding requirements, costs can be optimized by:
- Using shorter system prompts
- Reducing the number of tools
- Simplifying interactions
