- **Tool Integration**: Custom function calling and business-specific integrations
- **Multi-Business Backend**: Single platform managing multiple independent voice agents

**WhatsApp PDF Reader Bot**: Voice-first document narration with scalable multi-user handling using NestJS + Supabase

### 2. **Preferred TTS, STT & GPT Tools**
- **TTS**: ElevenLabs (natural prosody, multilingual, real-time streaming)
- **STT**: OpenAI Whisper, Deepgram, **OpenAI Realtime Transcription APIs**, **gpt-4o-transcribe**, **gpt-4o-mini-transcribe** (ultra-low latency, high accuracy, real-time streaming)
- **GPT**: OpenAI GPT-4o with Realtime Conversation API (multi-modal, tool-calling, streaming conversations)
- **Why**: Optimal balance of latency, voice realism, and cost-efficiency for production deployments

### 3. **Client Duplication Method**
Multi-tenant backend (Supabase + NestJS) with isolated business configurations, containerized microservices per client, and version-controlled settings enabling horizontal scaling

### 4. **MVP Delivery Time**
**7-10 days** with TTS/STT integration, call flow logic, business configuration UI, and comprehensive logging

### 5. **Availability**
Daily support (Pakistan timezone) with commitment to follow-up fixes and short-term post-MVP support
